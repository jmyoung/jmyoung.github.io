Just received a set of packages for most of the remaining parts for what I've ordered!Â  Busy night coming up tonight in that case ðŸ™‚

  * [AeroQuad v1.9 Shield](https://www.aeroquadstore.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=AQ1-009) (including standoffs and stackable headers)
  * HobbyKing [HK-7Xv2](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=10186) Transmitter and Receiver

I've got the ITG-3200 gyro at home, but I'm still waiting on the replacement BMA180, so I'm not quite done yet.Â  I've also just received confirmation that my shipment of a **lot** of jumper cable hardware (of various sizes to make receiver and ESC cables) is on its way by express post, so I should have that in the next day or two.Â  I'll start on assembling the shield tonight.

It's now time for me to start looking at a frame & ordering motors/esc's/propellors.Â  I've decided to get a whole bunch of spare props and a few spares motors just to ensure I'm covered for...Â  collisions.
