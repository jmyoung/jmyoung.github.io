Lately I've been having an issue where MediaPortal playback is choppy and suffers from screen tearing.  It turns out this happens when the Windows 7 Aero theme gets turned off.  I'm not sure why it's getting turned off sometimes, but at any rate you can force it on through the guide here;

I've applied this on my Media Center.  We'll have to see if it does the job.
