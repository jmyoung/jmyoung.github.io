Today, my [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs) rocked up!  I'm pretty happy that I did actually get in the initial batch, since it turned out that Farnell only got half of the Pi's, and RS didn't send _any_ of their 5000 to Australia.  So only a small number actually got out to the Great Southern Land, and it turns out that one of them is mine.  Happy days!

Haven't done too much with it yet.  I ran out and bought a pair of cheapo class 4 2Gb SD cards, and the the [Fedora 14 Remix](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/805) on one, and [OpenElec](http://openelec.tv/component/k2/item/242-openelec-meets-raspberry-pi-part-2) on the other.

Fedora is easy to set up, drives like normal Fedora.  Turns out though that a 2Gb SD card may be a bit small, and class 4 is hell slow when writing, so I reckon I'll go out and get a decent class 6 or something (there's problems with class 10 cards) in 4Gb.

OpenElec boots up and works pretty much straight off the bat.  I had some trouble with audio on playback, and also with _stopping_ it playing back, but considering it's a very early beta, that's not unexpected.  But it works, which is a great achievement for something that's as big as a credit card and costs AU$38.
