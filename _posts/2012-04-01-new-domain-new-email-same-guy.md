You may have noticed that [zencoding.blogspot.com](http://zencoding.blogspot.com/) now redirects here, to [coding.zencoffee.org](http://coding.zencoffee.org/) .  I finally got around to buying up my own domain and setting up Google Apps for it so I can have all my own email addresses and DNS and stuff.

Moving most of my accounts has proven to be less painful than I thought it would.  Most things support changing your email address and don't horribly wreck connected apps either.

Now, as for OpenID, a handy link for those who use it.  When prompted for OpenID, enter <https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id> as the ID, and it will use whatever Google account you're currently logged in as - including a Google Apps account, assuming that OpenID is enabled for your domain.
