Thought I'd link a heap of [DOTA2](http://blog.dota2.com/) learning resources and guides for people getting to know the game.  I'm still terrible, of course - don't get much time to play, and I only play vs. bots right now.  Anyway, these are the links I've found;

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong><a href="http://www.dota2alttab.com/">Dota2 Alt-Tab Guides</a></strong> - A cheat-sheet of all the heroes, a suggested build and a bit of info about all of them.  This is great to use in the Steam Web Browser so you can get an idea of what you're up against (or playing!).  I usually put these builds into the Build Editor so I can have them in-game without having to shift-tab all the time.</span>
  * **[Official Hero Info](http://www.dota2.com/heroes/)** - This is actually the info you get ingame, just in a browser.  You can use this page to edit your hero builds and review items and stuff without being in the game.
  * [**PurgeGamer's Welcome You Suck**](http://www.purgegamers.com/welcome-to-dota-you-suck) - Good starting guide, gives suggestions on heroes to avoid and heroes to use when starting off.
  * [**Comprehensive DOTA Guide**](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=123364976#19006) - Also a great guide.  Lots and lots of info.
  * **[DotaFire](http://www.dotafire.com/)** - Community website, has lots of builds, guides and a hero database.
  * **[DotaCinema](http://www.youtube.com/user/DotaCinema)** - Youtube channel features a lot of great info.  Notably, the Hero Spotlights and the Learn DOTA 2 playlist.  Worth a look.
  * **[Creep Blocking](http://www.team-dignitas.org/articles/blogs/DotA-2/3213/Dota-2-Why-and-Hows-of-Creep-Blocking/)** - Quick howto about creep blocking.
  * **[Universal Item Guide](http://www.dotafire.com/dota-2/guide/a-universal-item-guide-4900)** - A good guide to all the various items.

Enjoy.
