Bah.  I ordered a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) from Element-14 on the release day, but it looks like now it's about time I gave up hope.  I've most likely missed out on the first batch.  Oh well.

Here's hoping the next batch won't be too far away.  In the meantime, I'm thinking of ordering myself a [STM32 VL Discovery](http://au.element14.com/stmicroelectronics/stm32vldiscovery/board-eval-stm32vl-discovery/dp/1824325) from Element-14, to get started on ARM programming and do some experimentation.
