No change to locations, DNS redirects or anything, but I've renamed the blog.  The reason is that it turns out that [Zen Coding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Coding) is also a text editor plugin for writing CSS, created in 2008.  Now, I've had the name of this blog since March 2007, so I had the name first...  But eh, whatever.  The relevant names are;

  * **blog.zencoffee.org** - The "authoritative" DNS record going to this blog.
  * **coding.zencoffee.org** - URL redirect going to the above.
  * **zencoding.blogspot.com** - URL redirect going to the above.

Unfortunately the change to WordPress changed the URL format for all my posts, which has gone and busted any links people might have had, but they should get redirected to the homepage.
