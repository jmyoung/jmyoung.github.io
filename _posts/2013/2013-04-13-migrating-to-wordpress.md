Managed to lay my hands on a low-cost [VPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) solution, which should fulfill my needs, so I decided to migrate across my blog to WordPress, so I have a lot more control over it and can set it up the way I want.

Expect some weirdness and changes to appearance as I tweak with the various settings. Â I'll do a writeup on the adventure once I've got it sorted.
