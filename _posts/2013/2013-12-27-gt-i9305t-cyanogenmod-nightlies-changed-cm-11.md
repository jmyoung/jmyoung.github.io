Be warned!  As of Christmas Day, the CyanogenMod nightlies for the GT-i9305 series have changed over to CyanogenMod 11.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS TO WORK.</strong></span>

Go hit [this thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2524516) for info on the packages you'll need.  You will need, at minimum;

  * ClockworkMod 6.0.4.5 (from that thread!)
  * cm-11 Nightly Build (from get.cm will do)
  * gapps-kk build (from that thread)

Then, in order to make it work, flash things in this order;

  * Reboot your phone into recovery mode.  MAKE A BACKUP.
  * Flash the ClockworkMod ZIp.  Reboot again.
  * Flash the cm-11 build
  * Flash the gapps-kk build
  * Wipe the cache partition.  Reboot.
  * Pray

Good luck!
