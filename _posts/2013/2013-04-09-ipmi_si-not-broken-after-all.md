Well, it turned out that ipmi_si.ko was not broken after all in the new CentOS 6.3 kernels!Â  Red Hat changed the module to be included in the base kernel and not as a module, and therefore the way in which I was specifying parameters for it (through modprobe.conf) no longer worked.

Instead what you do to make it work is to append the following to the kernel options in /boot/grub/grub.conf ;

<pre><span style="color: #666666; font-family: Consolas;">ipmi_si.type=kcs ipmi_si.ports=0xca2</span></pre>

And then all is good!
