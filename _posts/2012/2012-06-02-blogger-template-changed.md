As I'm sure you've noticed, I've gone and changed the Blogger template I'm using.  The old template I used doesn't seem to be available anymore, and I wanted to get the most popular posts gadget in place.

Unfortunately, all of the templates that are available are fixed width!  I've set the width to 1200px, which should be OK for pretty much everyone.  Sorry.
