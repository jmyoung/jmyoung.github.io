Finished the [FT232R to FTDI-Cable](http://zencoding.blogspot.com/2011/05/ft232r-to-ftdi-cable-adapter.html) adapter I blogged about earlier.  Assembly was trivial - I just soldered female pin headers to a piece of prototype board and jumpered it all with some hookup wire.

      FT232R Adapter - Note high-tech texta markings
    </td>

</table>

The markings were made by a permanent texta, and serve to remind me that this is the 5V version of this adapter, and how the cable and breakout board plugs in.  Pretty straightforward, but quite useful.

At the top is the ArduinoISP Shield I made, so I can test the cable to make sure everything works fine.  It did.
