I decided to make up a desk mount for my HOTAS, so that I could position the stick in a more natural location without having to gorilla-arm it.  The design is very straightforward - it's a drill vice with a couple of pieces of steel bracket and soft-grip vice jaws to avoid marking the desk.  Total cost under $30.

If you want to replicate this, the spacing of the holes for the Warthog stick are 60mm apart, and are M4 metric screws.  Remember to leave enough clearance so you can push the stick the whole way forwards and not catch your fingers on the vice anywhere.
