Turns out my VPS provider has had a major outage, which bodes pretty badly considering it's my first month with them.  Service has been out for 24 hours now, with no real updates or any end in site.  This comes off the back of a week's worth of random small outages and severe packet loss.

Moving to a new provider.  Damn glad I set up backups, since I can't even get at the old VPS's console right now.
