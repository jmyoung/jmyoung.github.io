For Christmas, my wife got me a [Das Keyboard Ultimate S Silent](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate-silent/).  I'd wanted a good mechanical keyboard for ages, since I spend a huge amount of time typing away on a keyboard and I'd gotten sick of mushy membrane keyboards.  So, I got one for work.

Of course, it wasn't long before I couldn't stand my membrane keyboard at home, and needed a replacement, but shelling out for another Das was out of the question.  So that led me to the [Razer Blackwidow Ultimate](http://au.razerzone.com/gaming-keyboards/mechanical/razer-blackwidow-ultimate/).  It's a mechanical keyboard using the Cherry MX Blue keyswitches (versus the Das' Cherry MX Browns), so it's a fair bit louder and clickier than the Das.  It has key legends, with a backlight, USB hub, audio passthrough, and macro keys.  And it's pretty cheap for what it is.  I'm using one at home now.

So what's the deal with mechanical keyboards anyway?

I won't go into a big review of the differences, since there's plenty of resources on the 'net about it.  But suffice to say, if you type a lot, a mechanical keyboard is a godsend.  It's far more responsive and tactile than a membrane keyboard, and they're usually heavy and solid.

I was considering stuff like an old second-hand [IBM Model M](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard).  However, they lack newer keys and are very very loud.  Next on the list was the [Unicomp Customizer](http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/customizer.html), but again that is very loud.  Next up was the [Steelseries 6Gv2](http://steelseries.com/products/keyboards/steelseries-6gv2), but that has a non-standard L-shaped Enter key.  I needed a completely standard 104 keyboard, to preserve key compatibility with my legendless Das Keyboard. 

Next up, I'll give some commentary and feedback on what I think of the Das Keyboard and the Blackwidow from actual use.
