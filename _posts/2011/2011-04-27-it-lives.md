Wow.  It's been a _very_ long time since I've posted here.  I created this blog a long, long time ago with the intention of regularly posting my forays into IT.  However, it appears I never really got around to posting anything except for a few little snippets.

We'll give it another go.

This blog is having a minor change in purpose.  There will be all kinds of eclectic stuff posted here, so use the tags if a particular subject matter does / doesn't interest you.

Let's see whether I can keep the posting up this time around.
