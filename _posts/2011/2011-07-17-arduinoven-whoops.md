I've been finalizing the prototyping stage of the Arduinoven, and I've discovered something that's pretty obvious to someone who has worked with thermocouples before.  Not obvious to me though, until now.

Essentially, you can't run a thermocouple's electrical connections along a copper cable that's as long as the thermocouple.  You get enormous errors in the output of the thermocouple (up to 30 degrees!).

Instead, I'm going to have to make a small redesign so I can connect the thermocouple's cable directly to the Arduinoven board.

Updates once I've done so.
