I've decided to bite the bullet, and I'm working on converting my existing Microserver Centos 6 setup across to [Centos 7](https://www.centos.org/) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers for all my applications.

Why Docker? Â Why not [OpenVZ](https://openvz.org/Main_Page) or [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page)? Â KVM was out straight away because my Microserver simply doesn't have the spare CPU and RAM to be running full virtual machines. Â OpenVZ is an attractive option, but there's no non-beta release of OpenVZ for Centos 7. Â So that leaves Docker amongst the options I wanted to look at.

Asterisk poses some challenges for Docker, namely that the RTP ports are pseudo-dynamic, and there's a lot of them. Â Docker does proxying for each port that's mapped into a container, and spawns a docker-proxy process for each one. Â That's fine if you have 1-2 ports, but if you may have over 10,000 of them that's a big problem. Â The solution here is to configure the container to use the host's networking stack, then do some config on the container so that it uses a different IP from the host (to keep the host's IP space "clean"). Â We'll also be configuring the container as non-persistent so it pulls config (read-only) from elsewhere on the filesystem and stores no state between restarts. Â And lastly, we'll be using CentOS 6 as the Asterisk container OS (since Asterisk is available in the EPEL repository for that version). Â It's not a very new version of Asterisk, but it's stable.

Let's get started. Â For the impatient, here's the [gist](https://gist.github.com/jmyoung/a815823f2176c630c8f8).

# Create the Asterisk Container

First, we'll assemble a [Dockerfile](https://gist.github.com/jmyoung/a815823f2176c630c8f8#file-dockerfile). Â We'll base it off CentOS 6, and just install Asterisk. Â We use the ENTRYPOINT command so that we can pass additional arguments straight to Asterisk on running the container.

<pre>FROM centos:6

# Set up EPEL
RUN curl -L http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm -o /tmp/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm && \
 rpm -ivh /tmp/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm && \
 rm -f /tmp/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

# Update and install asterisk
RUN yum update -y && yum install -y asterisk

# Set config as a volume
VOLUME /etc/asterisk

# And when the container is started, run asterisk
ENTRYPOINT [ "/usr/sbin/asterisk", "-f" ]</pre>

Pretty simple stuff. Â Note that processes should always run non-daemonized in Docker so that it can track the pid properly.

# Prepare the Docker Host

Use whatever tool is appropriate (I'm forcing systemd, firewalld and network-manager on myself) in order to configure a second IP for your Docker host's primary network interface. Â Bleh. Â Network Manager.

Be aware that when you use the host's network stack in Docker and don't explicitly expose the ports you'll be using, Docker does not configure the firewall. Â You'll need to do that on the host. Â We'll cover that in the Makefile.

# Create the Makefile

We'll use a [Makefile](https://gist.github.com/jmyoung/a815823f2176c630c8f8#file-makefile) to handle all the tasks we're dealing with in this container. Â Here it is;

<pre>CONTAINER=asterisk
SHELLCMD=asterisk -rvvvvv

all: build install start

build:
 docker build -t zencoffee/$(CONTAINER):latest .

install:
 cp -f $(CONTAINER)_container.service /etc/systemd/system/$(CONTAINER)_container.service
 systemctl enable /etc/systemd/system/$(CONTAINER)_container.service
 firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 --proto udp -d 192.168.0.242 --dport 5060 -j ACCEPT
 firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 --proto udp -d 192.168.0.242 --dport 10000:20000 -j ACCEPT
 firewall-cmd --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 --proto udp -d 192.168.0.242 --dport 5060 -j ACCEPT
 firewall-cmd --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 --proto udp -d 192.168.0.242 --dport 10000:20000 -j ACCEPT

start:
 systemctl start $(CONTAINER)_container.service
 sleep 2
 systemctl status $(CONTAINER)_container.service

shell:
 docker exec -it $(CONTAINER) $(SHELLCMD)

clean:
 systemctl stop $(CONTAINER)_container.service || true
 docker stop -t 2 $(CONTAINER) || true
 docker rm $(CONTAINER) || true
 docker rmi zencoffee/$(CONTAINER) || true
 systemctl disable /etc/systemd/system/$(CONTAINER)_container.service || true
 rm -f /etc/systemd/system/$(CONTAINER)_container.service || true
 firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --remove-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 --proto udp -d 192.168.0.242 --dport 5060 -j ACCEPT || true
 firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --remove-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 --proto udp -d 192.168.0.242 --dport 10000:20000 -j ACCEPT || true
 firewall-cmd --direct --remove-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 --proto udp -d 192.168.0.242 --dport 5060 -j ACCEPT || true
 firewall-cmd --direct --remove-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 --proto udp -d 192.168.0.242 --dport 10000:20000 -j ACCEPT || true</pre>

Of course, I'm using firewalld here (bleh again) and systemd (double bleh). Â You can see that this simply does a build of the container, then puts the systemd service into place and punches all the appropriate RTP and SIP ports on the IP address that Asterisk will be using.

# Configure the Systemd Unit

Now we need a [unit](https://gist.github.com/jmyoung/a815823f2176c630c8f8#file-asterisk_container-service) for systemd, so we can make this run on startup. Â Here it is;

<pre>[Unit]
Description=Asterisk Container
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm=true --name asterisk -v /docker/asterisk/config:/etc/asterisk:ro -v /docker/asterisk/logs:/var/log/asterisk -v /docker/asterisk/codecs/codec_g723-ast18-gcc4-glibc-x86_64-pentium4.so:/usr/lib64/asterisk/modules/codec_g723-ast18-gcc4-glibc-x86_64-pentium4.so:ro -v /docker/asterisk/codecs/codec_g729-ast18-gcc4-glibc-x86_64-pentium4.so:/usr/lib64/asterisk/modules/codec_g729-ast18-gcc4-glibc-x86_64-pentium4.so:ro --net=host zencoffee/asterisk:latest
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop -t 2 asterisk

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</pre>

The run command there does a number of things;

  * Pulls Asterisk config from /data/asterisk/config (read-only)
  * Writes Asterisk logs to /docker/asterisk/logs
  * Pulls in a g723 codec and a g729 codec for Asterisk to use (read-only)
  * Enables host networking

If you are missing those codecs, remove the two -v's that talk about them. Â Also, you will likely have differently optimized versions anyway (Microserver has a pretty weak CPU, so Pentium4 is the right one to use for that).

# Edit the Asterisk Config

You'll need the default Asterisk config, which you can extract by building the container and running it up with;

<pre>docker run -d --name extract -v /docker/asterisk/config:/mnt zencoffee/asterisk:latest
docker exec -it extract /bin/bash
cp /etc/asterisk/* /mnt/
exit
docker stop extract
docker rm extract</pre>

From there, you can put in your own customized Asterisk config. Â There's a few bits you need to tweak. Â In sip.conf, set **udpbindaddr** and **tcpbindaddr** to the secondary IP that you want Asterisk listening on. Â in rtp.conf, ensure that **rtpstart** and **rtpend** match the ports you set up the firewall for.

# Finally, putting it together!

Put your **asterisk_container.service**, **Dockerfile** and **Makefile**Â into the same directory. Â Put your config into **/docker/asterisk/config** (in this example), your codecs into **/docker/asterisk/codecs**, and create a blank **/docker/asterisk/logs** .

You will also need a **cdr-csv** and **cdr-custom** directory in the logs dir if you want that functionality (Asterisk doesn't create it).

_Quickstart: Â Just **make all** to do the whole lot and start it ðŸ™‚_

  1. Run **make build** to construct the image.
  2. Run **make install** to configure firewalld rules and put the systemd unit in place
  3. Run **make start** to start the container
  4. Run **make shell** to get an Asterisk prompt inside the container

You can also do a docker logs asterisk to see what's going on, and you can start/stop the container like a normal systemd service.

Good luck!
