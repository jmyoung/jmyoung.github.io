title: ATM3R Modlist
---

This list was completed for ATM 1.5.2.  I've attempted to categorize mods somewhat to narrow down some interesting choices to look at.

# Major Pack Mods

These are the heavy hitters - mods with complete progression systems, huge numbers of machines and other integrated stuff.  I haven't included every one (I left out Refined Storage for example), focusing on the set that I think is most relevant to learn about and get a handle on, at least in part.

## Worlds/Dimension Mods

These create entire dimensions with their own gameplay and such.

| Mod Name | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Advanced Rocketry | Rockets, Moon landings, planets |
| Aroma1997's Dimensional World | Adds the Mining Dimension |
| The Betweenlands | Alternate dimension and a new Survival progression experience |
| Twilight Forest | Alternate dimension with its own progression and boss experience |

## Kitchen Sink Mods

These add a wide variety of all sorts of stuff, sometimes with a theme, sometimes not, but are powerful / useful enough to be key.

| Mod Name | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Actually Additions | Drills, utility machines etc |
| Cyclic | Many various helpful blocks and stuff |
| Dark Utilities | Various utility blocks |
| Draconic Evolution | Powerful end-game gear and machines |
| Extra Utils 2 | Miscellaneous extra blocks |
| Random Things | Kitchen sink mod with various things |
| Reliquary | Various magical items and equipment |

## Magic System Mods

Mods which are fairly complete ecosystems with a magical bent.  These will usually have their own progression, and they are often much more self-contained than the Tech Systems mods below.

| Mod Name | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Astral Sorcery | The magic of the stars.  Has rituals, telescopes and such |
| Blood Magic | Magic system using rituals, blood rites and alchemy |

| Roots | Magic of the Earth, has rituals and spells for growth and farming |
| Thaumcraft 6 | Highly detailed magic mod with golems, crafted spells, backfires etc |
| Wizardry | Magic mod with crafted spells |

## Tech System Mods

Mods which are fairly complete ecosystems with a technology bent.  These usually integrate with other mods, and often lean towards ore processing, power generation and automation systems.

| --- | --- |
| Applied Energistics 2 | Digital Storage, item/fluid transport and autocrafting |
| Ender IO | Machinery, resource conduits and redstone logic |

| Steve's Carts | Make specialized carts for automating activities |
| Thermal Expansion | Machinery and automation |
| Xnet | Item logistics mod with conduits and pipes |

## Resource Production Mods

Mods which provide much functionality around resource production / collection, power generation and so-on.  Other mods will also have this kind of functionality, but these mods specialize in it.

| --- | --- |
| Advanced Generators | Powergen and steam turbines etc |

| NuclearCraft | Nuclear reactors and other high tech stuff |
| Woot | Create factories for farming mobs, server friendly |

## Tools and Gear Mods

Mods which provide some kind of critical, important or powerful gear, block or capability - but are more focused in purpose than a kitchen sink mod.
